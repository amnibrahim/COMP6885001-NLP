# Large Language Models (LLM)

Focuses on leveraging state-of-the-art pretrained models, such as BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa, to solve a wide range of NLP tasks. LLMs can be fine-tuned for tasks like text classification, question answering, named entity recognition, and more, making them highly versatile. By exploring LLMs, students can gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology that often integrates techniques covered in earlier topics like sentiment analysis, document clustering, and summarization.

## **Advantage:**
Topic 6 offers a broad scope, enabling us to explore multiple aspects of NLP, including areas covered in Topics 1-5, such as text classification, summarization, and even conversational AI. This gives students a more comprehensive understanding of modern NLP techniques, making it an attractive option for those who want to explore the latest advancements in NLP.
